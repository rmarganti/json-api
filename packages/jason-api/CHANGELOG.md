## [1.3.0] - 2021-09-02

### Added

### Changed

## [1.2.1] - 2021-01-21

### Added

-   Add `queryCache` option to control when `useRequest()`
    and `useAutoRequest()` query the cache.

### Changed

-   Updated axios dependency.

## [1.1.1] - 2020-07-06

### Changed

-   Dependency list is no longer need for hooks, and `propsToWatch`
    is no longer necessary for High Order Components.
-   In-progress requests are handled better when an action change or
    component unmount occurs.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-02-17

### Added

-   Hooks (`useItem()`, `useCollection()`, `useRequest()`, `useAutoRequest`)
-   Code examples for both hooks and higher order components.

### Changed

-   Complete rewrite from ground up.
-   Much stronger & flexible typing.
-   Replaced `JASON_API_REQUEST` actions with `jasonApiRequest()` action creator.
-   Renamed `withQuery()` to `withAutoRequest()` to more closely match `useAutoRequest()`.
-   `withAutoRequest()` uses `actionFactory` that expects the result of a `jasonApiRequest()`
    instead of `queryFactory`, which simply expected a Promise.

### Fixed

-   Typing is compatible with recent versions of React and Typescript.

## [0.9.0] - 2018-04-15
